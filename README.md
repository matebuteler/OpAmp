# TDA2030 Amplifier Board 

A simple DIY mono amplifier board you can make at home! It's meant to be powered with a **single power supply** and can provide **14W of output power**. Should support up to 36V on its power input.

From the TDA2030's datasheet:

*At ±14 V or 28 V [Vcc], the guaranteed output
power is 12 W on a 4 Ω load and 8 W on an 8 Ω
(DIN45500).*

The board has three 2-pin Molex inputs: ***Vcc* (Power)**, ***Vs* (Audio input)** and ***RL* (Audio output)**
